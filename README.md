This is basically a classic Blackjack game where you play against the computer.

## How to play

- Your goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
- The computer draws cards until it reaches at least 17.
- You can draw a new card by pressing New Card or keep your current total by pressing Stay.
- If your total is closer to 21 than the computer's, you win!
- If your total is closer to 21 than the computer's, you win and gain +10 points!
- If you lose, you lose -10 points.
- If both totals are equal, it's a Draw.
